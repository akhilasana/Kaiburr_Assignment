# **Task 5: Text Classification on Consumer Complaint Dataset**

This project **classifies consumer complaints** into the following categories using **Machine Learning**:

## üìå Categories
0Ô∏è‚É£ Credit reporting, repair, or other  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Debt collection  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Consumer Loan  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Mortgage  

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### ** Prerequisites**
- Install **Python 3.9+**
- Install required libraries:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk

2. DataSet Description
1. Download consumer_complaints.csv from the link https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database
2. Ensure it has Complaint ID, Consumer complaint narrative, and Product columns.

3. Run the Model Training 
Use the script python kaibur.py to:
1. Load and preprocess data (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).
2. Train a multi-class classification model.
3. Evaluate the model (accuracy, precision, recall).

Command : python kaibur.py

4. Make Predictions
Use predict.py (or a notebook) to classify new complaints:

Command: python predict.py --text "My mortgage was unfairly processed"
Expected output: A label from {0, 1, 2, 3}.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
 1. Check dataset size, distribution of categories.
 2. Identify missing values in Consumer complaint narrative.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Text Preprocessing** (Tokenization, Stopword Removal, TF-IDF)
1. Tokenization, removing punctuation, lowercasing.
2. Removing stopwords (NLTK or spaCy).
3. Converting to TF-IDF or word embeddings.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Train Multi-class Classification Model**  (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
1. Try Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Random Forest.
2. Compare performance on a validation set

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Evaluate Model Performance**  (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)
1. Use metrics like Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, Recall.
2. Show confusion matrix or classification report.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Predict Complaint Categories**
1. Preprocess new complaint text.
2. Predict the category (0‚Äì3).
